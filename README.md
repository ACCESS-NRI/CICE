This repository contains files needed to run CICE versions 6 and higher of the sea ice model CICE, which is now maintained by the CICE Consortium.  Versions prior to v6 are found in the [CICE-svn-trunk repository](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE-svn-trunk).

CICE consists of a top level driver and dynamical core plus the Icepack column physics code, which is included in CICE as a git submodule.  Because Icepack is a submodule of CICE, Icepack and CICE development are handled independently with respect to the github repositories even though development and testing may be done together. 

CICE uses [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/cice-consortium-cice/) to maintain documentation and zenodo to manage the Digital Object Identifier (DOI).
