CICE version 6
  April 2017

This directory contains files needed to run version 6 of CICE, the CICE Consortium 
sea ice model, in standalone mode on a 3 degree grid.  As currently configured, 
the model runs on 4 processors.  MPI is used for message passing between processors, 
and OpenMP threading is available.  The grid provided here is too small for the code 
to scale well beyond about 8 processors. A 1 degree grid is provided also, without 
forcing data.

For additional information, please consult the CICE documentation 

--- To compile and run the model ---

Quickstart:

./create.case -c ~/mycase1 -g gx3 -m yellowstone -p 8x1 -s diag1
cd ~/mycase1
./cice.build
./cice.submit

A bit more information:

create.case generates a case, use "create.case -h" for help with the tool.
  -c is the case name and location (required)
  -m is the machine name (required)
  -g is the resolution (default is gx3)
  -p is the task x thread/task values (default is 4x1)
  -s are comma separated optional env or namelist settings (default is "null")
  -t is the test name and location (cannot be used with -c).
  -b is used to specify that a baseline dataset is to be generated (only used with -t)
  -bd is used to specify the location of the baseline datasets (only used with -t)

Several files are placed in the case directory
 - env.${machine} defines the environment
 - cice.settings defines many variables associated with building and running the model
 - makdep.c is a tool that will automatically generate the make dependencies
 - Macros.${machine} defines the Makefile Macros
 - Makefile is the makefile used to build the model
 - cice.build is a script that build the model
 - ice_in is the namelist file
 - cice.run is a batch run script
 - cice.submit is a simple script that submits the cice.run script

Once the case is created, all scripts and namelist are fully resolved.  Users can edit any 
of the files in the case directory manually to change the model configuration.  The file
dependency is indicated in the above list.  For instance, if any of the files before 
cice.build in the list are edited, cice.build should be rerun.

The casescripts directory holds scripts used to create the case and can largely be ignored.  

In general, when cice.build is executed, the model will build from scratch due to the large 
dependence on cpps.  To change this behavior, edit the env variable CICE_CLEANBUILD in 
cice.settings.  

The cice.submit script just submits the cice.run script.  You can use cice.submit or just 
submit the cice.run script on the command line.

The model will run in the directory defined by the env variable CICE_RUNDIR in cice.settings.  
Build and run logs will be copied into the case logs directory when complete.


--- Forcing data ---

The code is currently configured to run in standalone mode on a 3 degree grid using 
atmospheric data from 1997, available from http://oceans11.lanl.gov/trac/CICE/wiki.
These data files are designed only for testing the code, not for use in production 
runs or as observational data.  Please do not publish results based on these data
sets.  Module cicecore/dynamics/cicedynB/ice_forcing.F90 can be modified to change the 
forcing data.
