CICE version 6 testing
  June 2017

This README file documents how to use the testing suite developed for the
CICE Consortium sea ice model.  The tests currently supported are:
  1. "Smoke" test  - Ensures that the model compiles successfully and runs
                     to completion for a 1 day simulation.  Validation is
                     determined by performing a binary comparison on restart
                     files to a baseline dataset.
  2. 10-day test   - Ensures that the model compiles successfully and runs
                     to completion for a 10 day simulation.  Validation is
                     determined by performing a binary comparison on restart
                     files to a baseline dataset.
  3. Exact restart - Ensures that the output from a cold-start simulation
                     and a restart simulation provide bit-for-bit identical
                     results.
  4. Annual test   - Ensures that the model compiles successfully and runs
                     to completion for an annual simulation.  Validation is
                     determined by performing a binary comparison on restart
                     files to a baseline dataset.

--- To generate a baseline dataset for a test case ---

Quickstart (example):

./create.case -t smoke -m conrad -b
cd smoke_baseline_gx3_conrad_4x1
./cice.build
./cice.submit
# After job finishes, check output
cat test_output


--- To run a test case and compare to a baseline dataset ---

Quickstart (example):

./create.case -t smoke -m conrad -bd /path/to/baseline/restart
cd smoke_gx3_conrad_4x1
./cice.build
./cice.submit
# After job finishes, check output
cat test_output


--- To run a test case without comparing to a baseline ---

Quickstart (example):

./create.case -t smoke -m conrad
cd smoke_gx3_conrad_4x1
./cice.build
./cice.submit
# After job finishes, check output
cat test_output
